- Socket.IO is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers
- It simplifies the implementation of WebSockets and provides additional features like automatic reconnection
- multiplexing, and broadcasting events. It's easy to use and integrates well with both client-side JavaScript and server-side Node.js
